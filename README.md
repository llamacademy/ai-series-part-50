# Enemy GOAP AI

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/85kogmzcLXw) you can see a full, end to end implementation of an enemy AI with 2 types of attacks using [CrashKonijn's GOAP system](https://github.com/crashkonijn/goap). The llama has "hunger" and "saliva" that decrease over time and are only increased when eating, and one attack requires "saliva" in order to perform it.

## Quickstart
This repo uses [Crash Konijn's GOAP system](https://github.com/crashkonijn/GOAP) as the GOAP system we're building on. This is included via the package manager. It also uses a [Quirky Llama](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/llama-quirky-series-178234?aid=1101l9QvC) model which is less important, but the animation names that are played will need to be updated to whatever animations you choose to use.

1. Import Quirky Llama (or replace llama with your 3d model)
2. Import [Unity Particle Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/particle-pack-127325?aid=1101l9QvC) (free)
3. Click play!

The package manifest includes Navigation Components already.
